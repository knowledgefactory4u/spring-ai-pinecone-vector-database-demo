-------------
- **Spring Boot** based backend for API development.
- **Spring AI** for embedding text into vector representations.
- Integration with **Pinecone** for vector storage and similarity search.
- API endpoints for inserting and retrieving data with metadata filtering.

Project Structure:
-------------------
- **Spring Boot Web Starter** for REST APIs.
- **Spring AI with Pinecone** to perform embedding operations.
- **Pinecone Vector Database** for storing and querying vector data.
